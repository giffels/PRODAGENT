The DLS Component needs to use the DLS API that are external
to the CVS MCPROTO repository, some assumption are made on
the DLS API location.
This README describe how to:
 1. Download and setup the DLS API
 2. Perform bare tests of the DLS component

===============================================================

1) Download and setup the DBS API

-- download DLS API from CVS DMS repo to DLSInterface/DLSAPI
 
cd COMP/MCPROTO/src/python/DLSInterface
cmscvsroot CMSSW
cvs co -d DLSAPI COMP/DLS/Client/SimpleClient
cd DLSAPI


2) Bare test of the DLS Component:

2a) Start the ProdAgent Server and the DLS Component:

python COMP/MCPROTO/src/python/ProdAgentLite/ProdAgentServer.py &
python COMP/MCPROTO/src/python/DLSInterface/StartComponent.py &

2b) Fake the publishing of "NewFileBlock" event on the Server:
    The payload of the event contain the replica information ( the fileblock and its location). 

>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> prodAgent = xmlrpclib.Server("http://127.0.0.1:8081")
>>> fileBlockInfo= { 'fileblock': 'fakefileblock' , 'location' : 'fakeSE' }
>>> prodAgent.publishEvent("NewFileBlock", fileBlockInfo)


Note that the DLSComponent is not really inserting info into DLS,
the inserting command is only printed out.
